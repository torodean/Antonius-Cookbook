\chapter{Desserts \& Sweets}

Dessert is a confectionery course that generally concludes the main meal of the day. It usually consists of sweet and savory food or beverages. The term can refer to a large variety of different items and is derived from the French word desservir which means ``to clear the table.''\footnote{``Dessert". Merriam-Webster. Merriam-Webster Incorporated. Retrieved 15 October 2012} Because desserts are generally sweet, they are very likable by children which makes them a perfect incentive for literally clearing the table and cleaning up after a large meal (generally dinner in English speaking countries) in hopes to acquire their dessert.

\section*{Tips to a Healthy Dessert}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Is it possible to have a healthy dessert? Absolutely.
	\item Use sugar sparingly! 
	\item Be sparing on the sweets you eat and avoid them if you have not been active throughout the day.
	\item Make something with fresh fruits.
	\item Use real ingredients. Avoid highly process foods, artificial colors, etc.
	\item switch to Non-processed sweeteners from nature like honey and maple syrup! Make sure to get the real stuff. Honey is \textit{not} bad for you!
	\begin{itemize}
		\item ``Medicinal importance of honey has been documented in the world's oldest medical literatures, and since the ancient times, it has been known to possess antimicrobial property as well as wound-healing activity."\footnote{Mandal M. ``Honey: its medicinal property and antibacterial activity." 2011 Apr; 1(2): 154–160.	doi:  10.1016/S2221-1691(11)60016-6}
		\item ``There is now a sizeable evidence that honey is a natural immune booster, natural anti-inflammatory agent, natural antimicrobial agent, natural cancer “vaccine,” and natural promoter for healing chronic ulcers and wounds."\footnote{Othman, N. ``Honey and Cancer: Sustainable Inverse Relationship Particularly for Developing Nations—A Review." 2012; 2012: 410406. Published online 2012 Jun 17. doi:  10.1155/2012/410406}
	\end{itemize}
	\item Use Dark chocolates instead of sweetened chocolates.
	\item You can sweeten dishes in other ways than with sugar. Try cinnamon, cardamom, or other spices (depending on the flavors you want)!
