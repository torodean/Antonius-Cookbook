\chapter{Desserts \& Sweets}

Dessert is a confectionery course that generally concludes the main meal of the day. It usually consists of sweet and savory food or beverages. The term can refer to a large variety of different items and is derived from the French word desservir which means ``to clear the table.''\footnote{"Dessert". Merriam-Webster. Merriam-Webster Incorporated. Retrieved 15 October 2012} Because desserts are generally sweet, they are very likable by children which makes them a perfect incentive for literally clearing the table and cleaning up after a large meal (generally dinner in English speaking countries) in hopes to acquire their dessert.
