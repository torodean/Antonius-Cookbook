\chapter{Snacks, Sides \& Toppings}

A snack is a portion of food that is too small to consider a full meal. A side is essentially a snack that goes with a meal. A topping is meant to be served with a meal. Snacks are generally eaten between meals while sides and toppings are served either with a meal or with a snack. Snacks are typically prepared with ingredients commonly available for those times where you are not ready to prepare a planned meal but you are still hungry. Many of todays commercially available snacks are high in sugars and fats but are packed with flavor which are typically eaten due to a craving or to hold one over until the next meal. They are popular because they are usually sold in vending machines and easily accessible or store-able A much better snack by far is any combination of whole foods which include fruits, vegetables, nuts and berries which can serve as an excellent source of nutrition between meals when one finds them self in need of food.
