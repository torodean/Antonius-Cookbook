\chapter{Breakfasts}

Breakfast is the first meal of the day and an important part of the day in that it proves you energy early in the morning after sleeping through the night. The word refers to breaking the fasting period of the previous night. Any foods can be eaten for breakfast, as with all meals, but it is important to have a nutrition packed meal to revitalize you for the day. Breakfast has been popularly refered to as ``the most important meal of the day'' in some areas. Some epidemiological studies even link an association between breakfast consumption and a lower risk of type two diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome\footnote{Maki KC, Phillips-Eakley AK, Smith KN (2016). "The Effects of Breakfast Consumption and Composition on Metabolic Wellness with a Focus on Carbohydrate Metabolism". Adv Nutr. 7 (3): 613Sâ€“21S. doi:10.3945/an.115.010314. PMID 27184288.}.
