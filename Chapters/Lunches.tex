\chapter{Lunches}

Lunch is an abbreviation of the word luncheon. It is a meal typically eaten around midday shortly after second breakfast, elevenses, and before afternoon tea (if you're a hobbit that is). The word luncheon is derived from nuncheon which means light snack\footnote{Dhirendra Verma (1999). Word Origins. Sterling Publishers Pvt. Ltd. p. 52. ISBN 978-81-207-1930-9. Retrieved March 15, 2016.}, and can range from a light snack to a large meal. Since it occurs around midday when many people are still at work, it is often accompanied with a social gathering in which conversing happens. For this reason, lunches are generally made to be quick, tasty so that as to elicit conversation and not take up a significant portion of the day.
