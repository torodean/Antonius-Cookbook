\chapter{Dinners}

Dinner generally refers to the largest meal of the day in many English-speaking cultures. The word comes partially from an Old French word ``disner'' which means to ``dine'', combined with some Latin etymology\footnote{Etymology of "dinner" from Online Dictionary. Accessed November 11, 2009.}. In many parts of the world and even between many families, dinner falls within vastly different times of the day. Some prefer an early dinner shortly after midday while others prefer dinners late into the evening. Regardless of the time of day, dinner is generally the meal that would require the most amount of time to prepare compared to others as it generally falls after ones work day or even as a closing to it.

\section*{Tips to a Healthy Dinner}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Use fresh ingredients.
	\item Eat a variety of food.
	\item Eat smaller portions and stop eating when you are not hungry (don't over eat).
	\item Avoid products with a lot of ingredients to make your food simple!
	\item Don't cook with fatty meats. A lean piece of meat can contain as much if not more flavor than a fatty one if cooked and seasoned properly.
