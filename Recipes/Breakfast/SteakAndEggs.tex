Pre-heat oven to $205^\circ C$ ($400^\circ F$). Generously season the beef or venison. Seer all edges in a pan, place a few tablespoons of butter over top and set on a bed of whole garlic cloves in the pan. Place in oven for 10-12 minutes (or to desired wellness). Once finished, let rest for 8 minutes out of pan. While resting, warm a egg pan and add a drizzle of olive oil. Scramble eggs in separate bowl and dice chives and basil. Add scrambled eggs to egg pan followed by chives and basil. Cook eggs until done (omelet or scrambled) then season with salt and pepper.
