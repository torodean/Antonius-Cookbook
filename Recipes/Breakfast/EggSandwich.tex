\subsection*{Your Favorite Omelet}
You can use ingredients of your liking. This is a very versatile dish.

\subsection*{Preparation}
Toast English muffin or bread to desired level while preparing other ingredients. Scramble eggs in a separate bowl with a small drizzle of milk (this helps them fluff up) and dice other optional ingredients. Slice Summer Sausage into circles and place in a medium-low heat pan. When the sausages start to bubble, they are ready to be flipped. While that is cooking, in a hot pan, lightly drizzle olive oil and place in Minced Garlic and other optional ingredients\footnote{If you are using greens such as spinach, parsley, cilantro, etc. or cheeses such as cheddar, swiss, feta, etc., wait to put these in until the eggs are in.}. Saut\`{e} these until they start browning. Once browning begins, add eggs\footnote{This is when it is a good idea to add items such as Parsley, Spinach, cheese, etc.}. Place lobs of butter on edges of omelet as it cooks. Once cooked, add Salt \& Pepper and remove from pan. 

\tab When toast is finished, butter it. When sausage is finished, dab with paper towel to remove excess grease. Cut omelet in half or appropriate size for bread and assemble sandwich by bread|egg|sausage|bread. Enjoy with a side of fruit and a warm cup of tea for best breakfast results.


\subsection*{Tips}

Do not season the eggs before they are cooked. To practice flipping an omelet, you can get a piece of toast in an empty frying pan and flip it. A great way to slice spinach for use in something like this where you are not cooking it down for a while is to roll the leaves together and slice into strips (being careful not to crush the leaves). You can also make home made sausage with ground beef and the appropriate seasonings which will go brilliantly well as a replacement to any sausage. A small amount of fresh ginger is a great addition to most combinations of ingredients here. Cinnamon toast is also a great choice (and a childhood favorite of mine) for use with these sandwiches.
