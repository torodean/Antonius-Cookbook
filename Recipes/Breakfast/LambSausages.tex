		\item 1 lb Ground Lamb
		\item Sea Salt
		\item Ground Black Pepper
		\item Fresh Basil
		\item Fresh Sage
		\item Marjoram
		\item 1 Tblsp. Stone Ground Mustard

	\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}

\subsection*{Preparation}

Dice garlic and herbs. In a large bowl, mix thawed ground lamb with other ingredients. Once blended well, form into patties and cook over medium heat until done. flip after a few minutes to prevent burning of sides.

\subsection*{Tips}

Always slice fresh herbs gently as to not squish them. Squishing them will squeeze the juices out of them and they will become bitter. For fresh basil, it is easy to stack leaves on top of one another, roll them like a blanket, and then slice as if cutting a carrot.
