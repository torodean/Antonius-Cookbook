\subsection*{Preparation}

Preheat oven to $205^\circ$ C ($400^\circ$ F). The proportions on this one depend on how sweet you want it. I generally eye-ball everything. First, shred an apple (like you would cheese). In a large bowl, mix, sugar, cinnamon powder, a pinch of nutmeg, and a pinch of vanilla. Mix well as to coat the apples. Cute floured puff pastry into desired shapes and place on baking paper, place apple mix on top and cover with puff pastry or roll apple mixture into puff pastry. Gently cut slices into top of pastry to allow air in while cooking. Brush top with a melted butter and cinnamon mix. Cook until golden brown and crispy.


\subsection*{Tips}

Any type of apple can be used here, but it is best to find apples that have a light amount of water content as to not create a lot of moisture while cooking.
