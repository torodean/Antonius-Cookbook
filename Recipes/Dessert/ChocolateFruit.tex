\subsection*{Ingredients}
\begin{multicols}{3}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 1 70\% Dark Chocolate Bar
		\item $\frac{1}{2}$ Tablespoon Butter
		\item 1 Tablespoon Honey
		\item $\frac{1}{4}$ Cup Heavy Cream
	\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}

\subsection*{Preparation}

In a pot, warm the cream to just before a boil. Dice the chocolate into small pieces and place in bowl with butter and honey. Once cream is warm pour into chocolate mixture and gently mix with a spoon until blended. Let cool for 5-10 minutes and then mix well with a whisk to allow the mixture to aerate. This can be served as a warm topping or cooled and used as a fruit topping. Depending on the intended use, you may want to cool this for a short amount of time. My favorite use of this is in conjunction with the warm apple tart found in \ref{appletart}.

\subsection*{Tips}

The better the chocolate, the better the ganache.
