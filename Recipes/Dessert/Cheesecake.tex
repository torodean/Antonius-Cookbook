\subsection*{Ingredients}
\begin{multicols}{2}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 3 8 Oz. packages of Cream cheese
		\item 3 Eggs
		\item 2 Tablespoons Flour
		\item 1 Cup Cane Sugar
		\item 1 Large Lemon
	\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}

\subsection*{Preparation}
Preheat oven to $180^\circ C$ ($355^\circ F$). In a large Bowl, whisk cream cheese and sugar together until they are well blended and very soft. In a separate bowl, whisk 3 eggs together. Add the eggs to the cream cheese mixture one third at a time and whisk well after each addition. Once all of the eggs are in the mixture, add 2 tablespoons of flour and again blend well. Finish mixture off with the zest of a whole large lemon. For extra lemon flavor a small squeeze of lemon juice can be added as well. Pour the mixture into a buttered cheesecake pan. Gently tap the pan on a surface so that all of the gaps between the pan and mixture are filled. Bake in oven for 35-40 minutes.

\subsection*{Tips}
It will be much easier to mix the cream cheese if left out of the fridge for about 15 minutes before use.

\subsection*{Additions - Marble}
Although this recipe is great on its own, it is great served with raspberries or strawberries. One can also add a marble to the cheesecake using some Cherry Tart Concentrate. To do this, once the mixture is in the pan, pour a small amount of cherry concentrate over the center and swirl into the mixture with a large whisk.
