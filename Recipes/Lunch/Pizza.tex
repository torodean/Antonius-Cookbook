\subsection*{Flavored Crusts}

\textbf{Garlic Butter:} Mix melted butter with Garlic and Salt and brush over crust before cooking. \textbf{Sesame:} Brush crust with melted butter and lightly sprinkle sesame seeds around. \textbf{Parmesan cheese:} Mix finely grated Parmesan with melted butter and brush over crust.  

\subsection*{Preparation}

Preheat oven to $215^\circ$C (425$^\circ$F). Begin by Flouring hands, a rolling pin, and the dough lightly (this will prevent sticking). Roll out dough (or toss if you're adventurous) into circle. Place Sauce and spread to thinly cover crust. Lightly cover with Mozzarella cheese. Place favorite ingredients (or ingredients from recipe above) and seasonings on and bake in oven for 18-20 minutes.

\subsection*{Tips}

Everyone has their own taste and if you can find a pizza sauce you love, it's easy to store for long periods. If you have time you can even make your own! In general people have a tendency of putting more ingredients than needed. If you use too much sauce, the pizza will be runny. With too much cheese, it will not cook evenly, and with too much of the other ingredients, the pizza will not stay together when eating. If you are using leafy toppings, you will get best result if placed under the cheese when preparing.
