\subsection*{Tips}

Your favorite kind of tortilla wraps can be used with this recipe as well as your favorite kind of cheese. Personally, I buy raw tortillas and cook them upon serving. The warm tortilla tastes better and makes for a more impressive dish. As far as cheeses, I would recommend a sharp orange or white cheddar. This dish is fairly versatile and thus can be adjusted to the taste of the individual. By changing hte proportions around, you can make something that ranges from sweet to salty and everywhere in between.
