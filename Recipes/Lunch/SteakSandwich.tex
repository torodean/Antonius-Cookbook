This recipe was adapted from Gordon Ramsay's "The Ultimate Steak Sandwich" found on YouTube. I would recommend watching the video to see it prepared.

\subsection*{Preparation}
Pre-heat oven to $190^\circ C$ ($375^\circ F$)  In a hot pan, lightly drizzle olive oil and sear fillet on all sides. Lightly butter the fillet quickly or place small slabs of butter on top. Slice garlic clove into two pieces through the side and place them into pan with thyme on top. Use this as a bed to place fillet on top of and cook in oven for 10-15 minutes. When finished, let the fillet rest for 10 minutes and baste with juices from cooking.

In a separate hot pan, generously drizzle olive oil and add finely diced onions, bell pepper, and Jalape\~{n}o. Slice tomatoes in half and place them in pan as well. As the tomatoes heat up crush with a spoon. Add about a tablespoon on vinegar and cook until the mixture is no longer sour. Lightly slice basil leaves and add to completed mixture when desired consistency is met. 

To prepare sandwich, drizzle olive oil on sliced french bread and grill in pan until lightly charred (or to desired texture) on both sides. Slice fillet into strips. Mix in a small bowl 1 part mustard and 1 part mayonnaise and place on bread, followed by lettuce, fillet, relish and then topped with bread. Slice in half and enjoy!

\subsection*{Tips}
When slicing hte fillet, keep the pieces thick so that they retain their heat longer. Even to people who do not like either mayonnaise or mustard, mixing the two as described above gives a unique condiment unlike either individually. I have had personal experience with someone who did not like either on their own but liked the combination of the two. Be sure to cook the relish long enough after adding the vinegar so that the dish does not taste sour. Always taste ones cooking until it is as desired.
