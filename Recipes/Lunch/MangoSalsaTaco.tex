\subsection*{Preparation}
Begin by making Mango Salsa found in section \ref{MangoSalsa}.

\textbf{For Beef Tacos:} In a large hot pan, lightly drizzle olive oil and add ground beef mixture. Crush beef into pieces, add salt \& pepper, sliced basil and then cook meat thoroughly. Drain excess fat from the meat while it is liquid. 

\textbf{For Chicken Tacos:} Slice chicken breasts into thin strips. Season with salt \& pepper, cumin, garlic and paprika. In a large hot pan, lightly drizzle olive oil and add chicken strips.  Cook thoroughly until done and once fully cooked squeeze lemon juice over top to lightly blacken. Drain any excess juice and remove from heat.

Shred Cheddar cheese or another favorite kind of cheese (Colby jack goes well with this). Serve on your favorite tortillas as a build your own taco assembly line with other ingredients which is perfect and quick for dinner guests.

\subsection*{Tips}

The Mango salsa can be prepared the night before you plan on having this which makes this a perfect dish to quickly make for multiple guests since you only have to cook the meat. Personally, I prefer tortillas that you cook yourself because they add a warm shell to the taco and taste better. This is also slightly more work though. The thinner the chicken strips are cut the quicker they will cook.
