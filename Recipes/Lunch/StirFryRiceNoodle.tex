\subsection*{Preparation}

Slice all vegetables into pieces of the desired size. Place rice noodles into a bowl and pout boiling water over top. Let rice noodles sit in boiling water for 3-5 minutes or until soft and then strain. Try to time this so that they are done when ready to be placed into stir fry. In a hot stir fry pan, drizzle olive oil with 2-3 drops of sesame oil. Add diced garlic, diced ginger, onion, mushroom, and peppers to mix and cook down. Add Broccoli and carrots and cook until desired texture is met. Add a spray of amino acids and squeeze a lemon over top. Mix in rice noodles with the stir fry after draining them and add more amino acids to taste. 

\subsection*{Tips}

For a fancy look, you can slice carrots using a vegetable peeler. Don't overcook the vegetables because sometimes a soft/crunch to some of the vegetables adds a nice texture to the stir fry. If you do not have a lemon, other citrus fruit will give a great flavor too such as grapefruit, oranges, or limes!
