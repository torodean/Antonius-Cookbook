\subsection*{Preparation}

Preheat oven to $205^\circ$C (400$^\circ$F). You will need three separate containers for prepping the chicken.  These need to be large enough to fit a butterflied chicken breast. In the first container place flour and in the second eggs (whisked). In the third container, mix bread crumbs and grated Parmesan and season with sea salt \& pepper. The amounts of each ingredient depend on how much is being made. First, butterfly a chicken breast and coat it in flour, then egg wash, then the bread crumb mixture. In a warm frying pan place ~ a tablespoon of olive oil and a few drops of sesame seed oil. Lay coated chicken breast in pan for about 2.5 minutes then flip and cook for another 2.5 minutes (Should appear crispy and browned when turning). Depending on size of chicken breasts it may need slightly more time to finish cooking the chicken. If done, place on a pan, top with cheese, and place in oven until cheese is melted over top. This dish can be served atop a salad or alongside pasta with some marinara sauce.

\subsection*{Tips}

After coating the chicken Parmesan in bread crumbs, lay plastic wrap or wax paper over the chicken breast and gently roll over the top with a rolling pin so the bread crumbs are slightly pushed into the chicken (this will help it stay together).
