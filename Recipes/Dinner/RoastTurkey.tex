\end{multicols}

\subsection*{Preparation}
	Preheat Oven to $220^\circ$C ($425^\circ$F). Clean out insides and wash turkey (Make sure to remove bag of giblets stuffed in the neck if store bought turkey). In a bowl, mix butter, a pinch of salt and pepper, a tablespoon of olive oil, chopped parsley, and the zest and juice of 1-2 lemons (these amounts depend entirely on the size of turkey you are using). Use fingers to gently separate turkey skin from the meat on both the breast and thigh sides of the turkey. Place herb and butter mixture under the skin and spread around thighs and breasts of bird. Cut onions in halves and a lemon into slices and stuff turkey with those, bay leaves, and butter mixture. Spread remaining butter mixture atop bird. Drizzle olive oil atop bird and bake for 10 minutes. Remove bird, lower oven to $180^\circ$C ($350^\circ$F), baste, and lay strips of beef bacon over top of bird (optional). Return to oven and allow the bird to cook fully, basting often. After finished, let the bird rest for as long as it was cooked (this step is crucial). This will allow the bird re-absorb it's juices, and cool slightly so it is not very hot when carving.
	
\subsection*{Tips}
	A general rule with a turkey is that it needs cooked for about a half hour per kilogram (2.2 lb). Resting the turkey is crucial, and may seem strange but it enhances the flavor greatly. The onions and lemons that were cooked inside the turkey are perfect to be diced and used in a gravy with some rosemary and resting juices from the turkey. If the turkey is not fully thawed when ready to cook, it will not cook evenly and parts will be raw while others are done.
