\subsection*{Ingredients}
\begin{multicols}{3}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 1 small onion
		\item 3 cloves garlic		
		\item 1/2 tbsp olive oil		
		\item 1 lb ground beef		
		\item 1 jar spaghetti sauce
		\item 2 cups spinach		
		\item 2 cups cottage cheese
		\item 1 cup cheddar cheese
		\item 1 cup mozzarella and/or monterey jack
		\item 9 lasagna noodles
	\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}

\subsection*{Preparation}

In a large pot bring 6 quarts of water to a boil. Boil the lasagna noodles to al dente (8-9 minutes). Drain and set aside. Dice the onion into centimeter cubes and mince the garlic. In a large pan saut\`{e} the onion and garlic in olive oil on a medium-low heat. Once they begin to turn brown add in the ground beef and cook fully. Drain the fat from the beef and then add to it the jar of spaghetti sauce. Stir to combine then remove from heat. In a glass 9 by 13 inch casserole pan begin the layers with a thin coating of sauce to prevent the noodles from cooking to the bottom of the pan. Then lay in 3 noodles, a layer of meat sauce, a layer of cottage cheese, layer of spinach, and finally the mozzarella/cheddar/monterey jack. Repeat these layers until you have reached three and have used all your ingredients. The top layer should be cheese. Bake on 350 degrees covered for 45 minutes. Remove cover and bake 10 more minutes to allow cheese to brown. Enjoy!
