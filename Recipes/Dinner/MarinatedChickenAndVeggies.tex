Slice the chicken into cubes and place into a zip lock bag. Combine ingredients of marinade into the zip lock bag so that there is enough to coat all of the chicken with. Add about a teaspoon of paprika, basil, thyme, and garlic powder followed by a pinch of salt and pepper. Close the zip lock bag so that there is very little air inside and mix well. Let this sit in the fridge for anywhere from 2-24 hours before cooking.

\tab In a large pan, lightly drizzle olive oil and add diced onion and pepper. Saut\`{e} until soft then move to edge of pan and add contents of chicken and marinade to center. Cook until chicken is done. 

\tab Serve by creating a bed of rice on a plate followed by the chicken and vegetables and sprinkle with sesame seeds.
