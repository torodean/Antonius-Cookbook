\subsection*{Ingredients}
This recipe was based off of and modified from "Saffron Cardamom Ice Cream With Pistachios" found on www.food.com and introduced to me by Pranjal Tiwari.
\begin{multicols}{3}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 2 Cups Milk
		\item 2 Cups Heavy Cream
		\item $\frac{1}{4}$ Teaspoon Saffron Thread
		\item 8 Large Egg Yolks
		\item $\frac{3}{4}$ Cup Cane Sugar
		\item 2 Teaspoons Ground Cardamom
	\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}

\subsection*{Preparation}

Using a Pestal, finely ground saffron and add to cream and milk in a saucepan. Bring to boil. Remove pan from heat and let stand covered for 1 hour. Return pan to heat and bring the mixture to a simmer. In a separate bowl, mix egg yolks, salt and sugar together well so that they have a custard texture. Add half a cup of cream mixture into custard and mix well. Then mix rest of cream mixture in slowly while mixing. Place mixture back into saucepan and cook over medium-low heat while stirring until reaching $75^\circ$ C ($170^\circ$ F). Strain mixture through a fine sieve and add cardamom. Stir well and place pan in cold water to chill. Once cooled off, place in freezer. Every 25 minutes, stir to prevent water crystals from forming. Once too thick to stir, cover and let freeze.
