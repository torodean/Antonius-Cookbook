\subsection*{Ingredients}

\begin{multicols}{3}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 1 Packages Cranberries
		\item 1 Large Apple
  		\item 1 Small Package of Raspberries (optional)
		\item 1 Large Orange
		\item Cane Sugar or Honey
		\item Almonds or Walnuts
		\item Hemp seeds (optional)
		\item red wine
		\item Sea Salt
  		\item 1 Tbsp. Corriander Seeds 
	\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}

\subsection*{Preparation}
	Wash cranberries and let dry before cooking. In a large saucepan on medium-high heat, cover bottom in cane sugar or honey and allow to caramelize. Once the base is all caramelized and begins to bubble, add cranberries and mix (be wary of caramelized sugar as it will splatter if water is added and burn you). Mix/stir the pan often. Lightly season with a pinch of salt. Peal and slice the apple and add into the mixture once the cranberries start to become broken down (soft). Add in optional raspberries. Zest a whole orange into the mixture. Crush Corriander seeds and add to mixture. Once the mixture is to the desired cranberry consistency, add a splash (few tablespoons) of red wine to deglaze pan. Cook until alcohol is cooked out then dice almonds/walnuts with hemp seeds and add to mixture. Let cool and serve! 

\subsection*{Tips}
	If you do not like the bitter taste of cranberries\footnote{Why are you making this dish?}, you can increase the amount of sugar you use in the beginning.
