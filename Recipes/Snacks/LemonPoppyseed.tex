\subsection*{Ingredients}
\begin{multicols}{3}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $\frac{1}{2}$ Cup Softened Butter
		\item $\frac{2}{3}$ Cup Cane Sugar
		\item 2 Large Eggs (separated)
		\item 1 $\frac{1}{3}$ Cup Flour
		\item 1 Teaspoon Baking Powder
		\item $\frac{1}{2}$ Teaspoon Baking Soda
		\item 2 Tablespoons Poppy seeds
		\item 2 Large Lemons
		\item $\frac{1}{4}$ Teaspoon Sea Salt
		\item $\frac{1}{2}$ Cup Vanilla Yogurt
		\item 1 Teaspoon Vanilla
	\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}

\subsection*{Preparation}

Preheat oven to $175^\circ$ C ($350^\circ$ F). In a large bowl, mix butter and sugar until fluffy. Add egg yolks one at a time and whisk well after each. In a separate bowl, mix together flour, salt, baking powder/soda, poppy seeds, and the zest of 2 large lemons. Cut a large lemon in half and remove visible seeds. While mixing well (preferably with a mixer), insert about a third of the dry ingredients, then about a third of the yogurt, then about a third of the juice from half the lemon (be careful not to get lemon seeds in mixture) into the batter. Continue this three times and mix until smooth. 

In a separate bowl, beat egg whites until soft peaks form. Fold the egg whites into the batter until blended. Butter a baking pan or muffin tray and pour batter into prepared pan (about $\frac{3}{4}$ full). Bake for 20-25 minutes or until inserted toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 5 minutes, then remove from pan and allow to cool fully or eat warm!

\subsection*{Tips}

If you do not have an electric mixer, then beating the egg whites until fluffy will take a while. You can add the eggs in whole instead of separating them but they will not have as smooth of a texture when finished. If the egg whites are over mixed in (when separated), the muffins will have sunken tops when cooked. It may be a good idea to squeeze half of the lemon into a cup or bowl before adding it to a mixture that way you can remove any seeds that come with the juice. In total you want to add about 2 tablespoons of lemon juice so more than a half of a lemon may be needed. I have made this recipe with baking soda in place of baking powder and it turned out fine. This is not recommended but it can be done if you do not have baking powder.
