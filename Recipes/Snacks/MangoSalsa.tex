\subsection*{Ingredients}
\begin{multicols}{3}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 1 Orange Bell Pepper
		\item 1 Large Tomato
		\item 1 Large Mango
		\item 1 Large Red Onion
		\item 1 Large Jalape\~{n}o
		\item Fresh Cilantro
		\item 1 Tablespoon Olive Oil
		\item 1 Teaspoon Honey
		\item Salt \& Pepper  
	\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}

\subsection*{Preparation}
Finely dice Bell Pepper, Tomato, Mango, Red Onion and Jalape\~{n}o and place in medium to large bowl. Slice Cilantro while being careful not to squish the leaves and combine in bowl. Drizzle olive oil and honey over top mixture and stir/mix to combine ingredients evenly. To finish add Salt \& Pepper to taste.

\subsection*{Tips}

For less spice, remove the seeds from the jalape\~{n}o before dicing. In general the olive oil and honey cut down on the spicy impact of the jalape\~{n}o so this may not be needed. For a better mixed salsa, dice the ingredients into smaller pieces.
