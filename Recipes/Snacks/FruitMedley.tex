\subsection*{Ingredients}
\begin{multicols}{3}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 1 Apple
		\item 1 Banana
		\item Blueberries
		\item Strawberries
		\item 1 Pear
		\item Sliced Almonds
		\item Hemp Seeds
		\item Raisins or Grapes
		\item lemon
	\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}

\subsection*{Preparation}

Slice all of the fruit ingredients to desired size (apple last). Zest one lemon onto the fruit and squeeze a small amount of lemon juice onto the mixture (this will prevent the apples from turning brown). Combing all of fruit ingredients into a large bowl. Mix in almonds and top with shelled hemp seeds.

\subsection*{Tips}
Using whole almonds will make this harder to eat so only used slice almonds. Slicing the almonds make it much easier to bite through which evens the texture out for this dish. This is perfect served with breakfasts, stored in the fridge for a few days, or topped with vanilla yogurt!
